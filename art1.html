Cavan: Sammy! Can you get Oliver inside here to help? <br>

Sammy: I tried man, but bro won’t budge. <br>

Cavan: What in the world is he even doing out there? Does he realize the party is in three hours? <br>

Sammy: Oh yeah, he knows. I’ve told him only a thousand times. But he still chooses the wand every single time. <br>

Cavan: I swear man I’m going to scream for him to come inside one last time before I go out there and make him. Oliver!!!!! GET INSIDE NOW AND HELP US WITH THE PARTY! <br>

He doesn’t budge. He twirls his wand without a break in motion when Cavan yells for him. He is so focused on his craft that he doesn’t realize his lord and savior, Jesus Christ, appear out of thin air and enter the house.  <br>

Jesus enters. <br> <br>

<br>Cavan: OH MY GOSH, IT’S JESUS CHRIST! <br>

Cavan kneels to the floor, immediately entering into confession. <br>

Jesus: Rise my child. Come to me and tell me, what do you seek? <br>

Cavan: I seek to be saved, my Lord. Please. <br>

Jesus: And you my child? <i>Directed to Sammy</i> <br>

Sammy: I seek for Oliver to help us set up for this party! <br>

Jesus: I understand my child. May I ask you something? <br>

Sammy: Of course my Lord. <br>

Jesus: How many times have you called for him to come inside? <br>

Sammy: Maybe once or twice. <br>

Jesus: My child, you know I know all. And if I recall correctly, you actually called him eight separate times.  <br>

Sammy: Yes, my Lord. I am sorry for lying.  <br>

Jesus: It is okay my child. May I ask you one more thing? <br>

Sammy: Of course my Lord. Anything. <br>

Jesus: If you have called him eight times and there has been no change in the result, do you think that what he is doing might be more important to him than the party? <br>

Sammy: I don’t doubt that Lord. However, we really need the help and he is completely gnoring us. <br>

Jesus: My child, you may not persecute others for doing what they believe is the better thing. If they are clean of conscience and truly trust their belief, then in their mind they are innocent. And by my word, they shall be free from judgement. Instead of purging him for what he is doing, come to the understanding that he is doing what he truly believes what is better. Therefore, you should support him. I would say the same to him if he was in your shoes. <br>

Sammy: Yes my Lord. I shall. <br>

Jesus: Godspeed, my children. <br>

<i>Jesus steps back as His body slowly fades to dust. He is gone, yet he is still here. Cavan turns to Sammy.</i> <br>

Cavan: Dude. <br>

Sammy: What? <br>

Cavan: We just met J.E.S.U.S. C.H.R.I.S.T.!
